# CS499-Database-Enhancement

To run this application, you need to ensure the movies data set is uploaded to your local MongoDB. The connection string in the code defaults "localhost" and port "27017". Create a new database named "movie_list" and within that database create a collection named "movies". Within "movies", you can add the contents of the movies.json file included in the enhancement folder. After the data set is uploaded, you can clone the repository, download the dependencies, and run the main.py file within the enhancement folder.
